## CSV & Pandas

- The industry standard for handling csv 
- [Pandas] (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
- Aparently panda does not like double quotes "" & use full paths if possible
- a number of events, objects, or people of a similar or related kind coming one after another     
- working with dataframes is similar to working as dict
